Hi!! Welcome to my blog ~ You can find my writeups & other
cybersecurity-related stuff here!

I'm Samuel Goh, a 21-year-old student from Singapore. I'm currently studying in
Institute of Technical Education College Central (ITE-CC) & doing my Internship at
Custodio Technologies. I love playing CTFs & learning new stuff (っ´ཀ`)っ -- Team Name: char kway teow

Besides playing, I've also created some basic challenges for ITE-CC Network & Security (NST) Club's CTF Gym. Outside of CTFs, I love cycling  (especially in JP ⛩️) & have done a 1500km cycling trip from Kagoshima to Tokyo.
